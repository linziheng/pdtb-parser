Implicit|||||||||||Expansion|||||||||||2408..2549|14|Introduction Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is characterized by infiltrations of macrophages and T cells into the joint , and synovial hyperplasia .||||||||2551..2667|15|Proinflammatory cytokines released from these cells are known to be important in the destruction of joints in RA [ 1 ] .|||||||||||||
Implicit|||||||||||Expansion|||||||||||2669..2922|16|The favorable clinical benefits obtained with inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - α ) and interleukin ( IL ) -1 suggest that the blockade of key inflammatory cytokines has been the important issue in the development of new therapeutic applications [ 2 ] .||||||||2926..3115|17|A little over a decade ago , the primacy of T cells in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease such as RA was undisputed because they are the largest cell population infiltrating the synovium .|||||||||||||
Implicit|||||||||||Expansion|||||||||||3117..3371|18|However , a series of studies demonstrated paucity of T cell-derived cytokines such as IL-2 and interferon-γ in the joints of RA , whereas macrophage and fibroblast cytokines including IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-15 , IL-18 and TNF-α were abundant in rheumatoid synovium .||||||||3373..3450|19|This paradox has questioned the role of T cells in the pathogenesis of RA [ 3 ] .|||||||||||||
Implicit|||||||||||Expansion|||||||||||3452..3702|20|Because we have already demonstrated the enhanced proliferation of antigen specific T cells , especially to type II collagen , and the skewing of T helper type 1 ( Th1 ) cytokines in RA [ 4 ] , the role of T cells needs to be elucidated in different aspects .||||||||3706..3836|21|IL-17 is one of the inflammatory cytokines secreted mainly by activated T cells , which can induce IL-6 and IL-8 by fibroblasts [ 5 ] .|||||||||||||

Implicit|||||||||||Expansion|||||||||||4449..4632|25|Levels of IL-17 in synovial fluids were significantly higher in patients with RA than in patients with osteoarthritis ( OA ) , and it was produced by CD4 + T cells in the synovium [ 11,12 ] .||||||||4636..4844|26|IL-15 , secreted from activated macrophages , has been reported to be an important trigger of IL-17 production in RA peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) by cyclosporine and steroid sensitive pathways [ 13 ] .|||||||||||||
Implicit|||||||||||Expansion|||||||||||4846..4987|27|Recently , Happel and colleagues also showed that IL-23 could be an efficient trigger of IL-17 production from both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells [ 14 ] .||||||||4991..5189|28|Although the contribution of IL-17 in joint inflammation in RA has been documented in earlier studies [ 12,15,16 ] , the intracellular signal transduction pathway for IL-17 production remains uncertain .|||||||||||||
